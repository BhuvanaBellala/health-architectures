# Secure FHIR Proxy

Secure FHIR Proxy is an Azure Function based solution to act as an intelligent FHIR based reverse proxy.
It is integrated with Azure Active Directory to provide Role based access control.  This solution contains the following examples:
 + ProxyBase - A generic FHIR Proxy with no business logic validation and only authentication verification. You can use this sample to build your own business purpose driven proxy to perform any pre processing and post processing tasks for FHIR server calls.
 + ParticipantAccess - A sample FHIR Proxy that will filter returned patient based resources to only include Patients where you are the patient or are a "Practitioner of Record" (e.g. in a participant role and are part of the patient care team) Note: this only filters patient based resources
 + SecureLink - A administration function that links AAD Principals in roles for the FHIR server with cooresponding FHIR Resources to establish a map between AAD Role Identity and FHIR
